###Commit_Title
    GLK: Remove Zero Sized Allocation from Quetzal Code


###Commit_Description
    The behaviour of malloc and similar functions when called with a zero sized parameter is implementation dependent resulting in subtle portability bugs and should be avoided. This will generate warnings in GCC if -Walloc-zero is passed.
